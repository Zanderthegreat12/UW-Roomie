# Report:

4/27 Meeting Agenda:
Review overview of our Software design/architecture


## Team Report:
#### First subsection:
- Finish creating the survey questions - Bella and Alex 
- Connection between database and survey - Colby 
- Create code structure for our project - Everyone 
- Practice handling queries with Node.js - Bella 
- Start designing user interface - Leah 
- Start creating SQL query functions - Colby 
- Create prototypes for database - Bella and Colby

#### Second subsection:
- Finished the survey questions and created a google doc to get feedback on them
- Continued setting up the platforms we will be coding on.
- Created a prototype of the front end of our app
- Started creating the matching algorithm
- Set up the backend build

#### Third subsection:
- Finish gather data about our questions. (Bella and Alex)
- Finish creating the initial Matching Algorithim. (Alex)
- Create fake user profiles for testing. (Bella)
- Start implementing query functions for the database. (Colby)
- Get user input about the front-end design. (Leah)
- Implement user interface in React. (Leah)

## Individual Reports:

### Alex:
#### First Subsection:
- Finalized the survey questions
- Create a prototype Matching Algorithm
- Set-up React Native on my computer

#### Second Subsection:
- Created a google survey to gather data about our questions
- Started to work on the matching algorithm.
- I learned that creating a reflexive result based on ranking of dorms is fairly difficult.
  This is primarily where I am stuck at since making rankings reflexive is complicated so I need to
  do some reseach on it.

#### Third Subsection:
- Finish gather data about our quesitons
- Finsh creating the inital Matching Algorthim
- Start working on a method which runs through and
  scores the compatability between one person and
  everyone else using the platform.

### Colby:
#### First subsection:
- Setup a way to build the backend java code to test queries
- Edit my database schema based off survey questions
- Create basic functions to query database for matching algorithm

#### Second subsection: 
- Setup backend build using Maven (Can test code now)
- Set up Survey Table to store survey answers
- Created and successfully tested simple clearTable function

#### Third Subsection:
- Create API for my class Query
- Implement Query Functions associated with account management

### Leah:
#### First subsection:
- Update prototype after receiving Vinayâ€™s feedback and ask more target users for feedback
- Start designing the user interface in Figma
- Get comfortable with React Native

#### Second Subsection:
- Received positive feedback from Vinay and some target users on the low-fidelity prototype
- Created a high-fidelity prototype in Figma for further user testing
- Started playing with React Native and read documentation 

#### Third Subsection:
- Get user feedback on the high-fidelity prototype 
- Start implementing the user interface design with React Native

### Bella:
#### First subsection:
- Practice using Node.js with SQL so that I can be ready when Colby has the database set up.
- Finish the survey questions and plan how they will relate to the matching algorithm and database
- Download and set up React Native.
- Create prototype users for testing matching algorithm and database

#### Second subsection:
- I finished the survey questions with Alex.
- I started gathering data and feedback about the survey. This allows us to:
  - Create fake user profiles for testing.
  - Update the survey according to people's feedback.
- I researched more on how to do API calls with Node.js. This is still what I am stuck on since I have not gotten many
opportunities to practice with it.

#### Third subsection:
- Create at least 20 fake user profiles for testing the matching algorithms.
- Download and set up React Native.
- Practice using Node.js with SQL.
- Start planning the API calls with Node.js
- Talk to Alex/Colby to figure out how to format the data I retrieve from the database for the algorithm.
