#### Second subsection:


#### Third subsection:


## Individual Reports:

### Alex:
#### First Subsection:
- Finalized the survey questions
- Create a prototype Matching algorithm
- Set-up React Native on my computer

#### Second Subsection:


#### Third Subsection:


### Colby:
#### First subsection:
- Setup a way to build the backend java code to test queries
- Edit my database schema based off survey questions
- Create basic functions to query database for matching algorithm

#### Second subsection: 
- Setup backend build using Maven (Can test code now)
- Set up Survey Table to store survey answers
- Created and successfully tested simple clearTable function

#### Third Subsection:
- Create API for my class Query
- Implement Query Functions associated with account management

### Leah:
#### First subsection:
- Update prototype after receiving Vinayâ€™s feedback and ask more target users for feedback
- Start designing the user interface in Figma
- Get comfortable with React Native

#### Second Subsection:


#### Third Subsection:


### Bella:
#### First subsection:
- Practice using Node.js with SQL so that I can be ready when Colby has the database set up.
- Finish the survey questions and plan how they will relate to the matching algorithm and database
- Download and set up React Native.
- Create prototype users for testing matching algorithm and database

#### Second subsection:
- I finished the survey questions with Alex.
- I started gathering data and feedback about the survey. This allows us to:
  - Create fake user profiles for testing.
  - Update the survey according to people's feedback.
- I researched more on how to do API calls with Node.js. This is still what I am stuck on since I have not gotten many
opportunities to practice with it.

#### Third subsection:
- Create at least 20 fake user profiles for testing the matching algorithms.
- Download and set up React Native.
- Practice using Node.js with SQL.
- Start planning the API calls with Node.js
- Talk to Alex/Colby to figure out how to format the data I retrieve from the database for the algorithm.
