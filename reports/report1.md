# Report:

4/20 Meeting Agenda:
Review user interface design prototype


## Team Report:
#### First subsection: N/A

#### Second subsection:
- We set up our Git repository and practiced using Git 
  - React Native and SQL connection set up on GitHub 
- We did research in our respective fields to be ready to start the project.
  - Node.js 
  - Matching algorithms



#### Third subsection:
- Finish creating the survey questions - Bella and Alex 
- Connection between database and survey - Colby 
- Create code structure for our project - Everyone 
- Practice handling queries with Node.js - Bella 
- Start designing user interface - Leah 
- Start creating SQL query functions - Colby 
- Create prototypes for database - Bella and Colby


## Individual Reports:

### Alex:
#### First Subsection: N/A

#### Second Subsection:
- I did a bit of research into different Matching algorithms used on different sites like Tinder. It’s the thing that I am 
mainly stuck on as there are a lot of different algorithms that I need to look at and I’m not sure if I should make use 
of them or create my own. 
- I set up VSCode so that I could use it when working on this project. <br>
- Started to create survey questions with Bella <br>

#### Third Subsection:
- Finalized the survey questions <br>
- Create a prototype Matching algorithm <br>
- Set-up React Native on my computer <br>

### Colby -
#### First subsection: N/A

#### Second subsection: 
- I successfully set up an SQL server on AWS and got a connection set up to my computer. I was able to create tables on the server successfully. 
- I created an initial schema for our SQL database. 
- I got React Native set up on my computer

#### Third Subsection:
- Setup a way to build the backend java code to test queries
- Edit my database schema based off survey questions
- Create basic functions to query database for matching algorithm

### Leah -
#### First subsection: N/A

#### Second Subsection:
- Worked on getting React Native set up on my computer
- Started creating a simple paper prototype of the user interface design to present to Vinay for feedback on Thursday
- I am currently not stuck on anything

#### Third Subsection:
- Update prototype after receiving Vinay’s feedback and ask more target users for feedback
- Start designing the user interface in Figma
- Get comfortable with React Native

### Bella -
#### First subsection: N/A

#### Second subsection:
- Worked on getting git set up on my computer.
- Started planning the survey questions with Alex. We need to figure out how it will be used for the matching algorithm, but also be stored in the database.
- Did a bit of research on how Node.js relates to MySQL. This is what I’m currently stuck on since I have not gotten a chance to practice with it.

#### Third subsection:
- Practice using Node.js with SQL so that I can be ready when Colby has the database set up.
- Finish the survey questions and plan how they will relate to the matching algorithm and database
- Download and set up React Native.
- Create prototype users for testing matching algorithm and database
