# UW-Roomie
UW Roomie is a phone application where students who are planning on dorming 
can go to find roomates based on their preferences. 
Upon creating an account they will be prompted to fill a survey which describes 
their characteristics and the characteristics that they are looking for in a roommate.
From there the matching algorithm will find people 
who answered similarly and display those people to the user. 
If the user likes one of the potential dormmates, 
then they can attempt to get in contact with that user 
and if the other user agrees then it will display their contact information. 
From there then the users can determine if they want to dorm or not. <br /> <br />
